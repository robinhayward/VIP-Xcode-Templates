# VIP Xcode Templates

A set of templates to speed up the development of apps using VIP architecture.
Example project included to see what the templates create and how they can be used.

# Installation

Copy the `VIP.xctemplate` folder to the Xcode templates folder with the command below:

```shell
cp -R VIP.xctemplate ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/
```

Note: If this fails, you most likely do not have the template folders created yet, use the command below to create them and try again.

```shell
mkdir -p ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/
```
